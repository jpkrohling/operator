# How to Contribute to TracingShift

We'd love your help!

This project is [Apache 2.0 licensed](LICENSE) and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions on development workflow, contact points and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.

We gratefully welcome improvements to documentation as well as to code.

## Getting Started

### Workflow

It is recommended to follow the ["GitHub Workflow"](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/). When using [GitHub's CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli), here's how it typically looks like:

```
$ gh repo fork github.com/tracingshift/operator
$ git checkout -b your-feature-branch
# do your changes
$ git commit -sam "Add feature X"
$ gh pr create
```

### Pre-requisites
* Install [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
* Have a Kubernetes cluster ready for development. We recommend `minikube` or `kind`.

### Local run

Build the manifests, install the CRD and run the operator as a local process:
```
$ make run
```

## Testing

With an existing cluster (such as `minikube`), run:
```
USE_EXISTING_CLUSTER=true make test
```

Tests can also be run without an existing cluster. For that, install [`kubebuilder`](https://book.kubebuilder.io/quick-start.html#installation). In this case, the tests will bootstrap `etcd` and `kubernetes-api-server` for the tests. Run against an existing cluster whenever possible, though.

## Project Structure

For a general overview of the directories from this operator and what to expect in each one of them, please check out the [official GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/tracingshift/operator) or the [locally-hosted GoDoc](http://localhost:6060/pkg/github.com/tracingshift/operator/)

## Contributing

Your contribution is welcome! For it to be accepted, we have a few standards that must be followed.

### New features

Before starting the development of a new feature, please create an issue and discuss it with the project maintainers. Features should come with documentation and enough tests (unit and/or end-to-end).

### Bug fixes

Every bug fix should be accompanied with a unit test, so that we can prevent regressions.

### Documentation, typos, ...

They are welcome!
